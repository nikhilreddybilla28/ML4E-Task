Crop damage - (ML4E club)
conclusion:

deep neural networks:imbalance effect

lgbm:Best cv accuracy with good fscore

random foorest :best fscore and very good accuracy(on cv)

conclusion:Given metric is accuracy , 
>lgbm is optimal model however fscore need to be considered because the data is imbalanced
and goal is to find the damaged crop which is least dominant .Here accuracy with small fscore is not a good predictor.
